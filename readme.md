## Starting off

We created this project in idea via spring initializr. We picked the Web, Data-JPA and Derby dependencies.

Derby is an embedded database that we are going to use for now. We'll switch to a legit one later.

We then copied over our topic files from [the first project](https://github.com/KProskuryakov/learning-spring-javabrains).

Nothing else has been changed.
